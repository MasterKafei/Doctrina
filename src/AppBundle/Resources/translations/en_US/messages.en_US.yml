    description: |
        Doctrina is a knowledge sharing platform that can be used by all Supinfo students
        to help everyone learn more easily. This platform is in essence 100% collaborative,
        in fact each person can contribute with creation of tests, exercises, or course summaries.
        Whenever a person contributes, his work is added to Doctrina (after verification of the
        content by a member of the validation team), this allows Doctrina to be an autonomous
        platform that brings together everything they have need for their revisions. A contribution
        can also be linked to the KWS subject matter, indeed a contribution is a knowledge sharing
        in its own right!
